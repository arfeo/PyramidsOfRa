# Pyramids of Ra

THE MAZE CRAZY PUZZLE CHALLENGE THAT WILL AMAZE YOU!

Weave your way through the maze of passages which takes you within the ancient tombs and causeways of the Pharaohs. The seeemingly innocent and sturdy-looking floor tiles can move, change, flip and reverse your direction at anytime, throwing you for a serious loop. And, throughout the tangled labyrinth of causeways, there are scarab beetles hiding in the tiles, trying to block your way.
But if you can gain the power of the sun god, "Ra", you just might have the skill and cunning to find your way to the Tomb of the Pharaoh, Scarabeus.
So, if you're ready for the challenge of your life, power up `Pyramids of Ra`. You'll be amazed.
